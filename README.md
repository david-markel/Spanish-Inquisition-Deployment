# Spanish-Inquisition-Deployment

This is the working repo for the deploment of my 'Spanish Inquisition' app, which is essentially a clone of Kahoot. Developed for the purposes of integrating many technologies like Redis and Docker for a full stack web app. Was originally developed here as a group project for school, https://github.com/nmfanguy/cop4521-project. This repo, however has been created so that I can implement the backend myself in a different backend framework, Django, so that I can deploy it on my own.
